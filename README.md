# SAP-Navigation-ChromeExtension
Chrome Extension for Fiori Launchpad Navigation

This Chrome extension should make the use of the Fiori Launchpad more easy, userfriendly and faster.

It is targeted for Supplier Invoice but I am glad to enhace it with other links as well. Just let me know either here in GIT Hub or D064957.


## Installation
In order to add the Chrome Extension go to:
chrome://extensions
Enable the developer mode (top right corner)
Then click "Load unpacked" and select the corresponding folder for all four extensions

If you want to be able to use them in incognito mode, you can set the flag in the extension details

They should be loaded now.

In order to see the Links, rightclick the Extension and click "options".
Select all the links that should be available in the respective extension.
